终于翻出《How to Become a Straight A Student》来看了，发现有很多东西和以前导师讲的都是一个道理。读到其中描述一种抓耳挠腮的状态的一段话，很有画面感，感觉很有意思。

> Many eager students have succumbed to the horrors of research recursion syndrome—an unhealthy need to go find “just one more source,” often leading to hours and hours of wasted time, dorm rooms overwhelmed with teetering stacks of books, and one seriously sleep-deprived student. This is grind territory, and you should avoid it at all costs.

打算把剩下的第三部分看完之后把笔记一起更新。
