## 一些细碎的心情

突然想起了一个月之前去看的《我，堂吉诃德》，于是跑去搜了下 YouTube 里有的影像，挨着看了一遍，越听越喜欢 The Impossible Dream 这歌，像是有种魔力，带给人力量且让人不禁动容。我想我会把歌词拎出来做个页面表达我对它的喜爱。

2017 年开始，我的日历总算可以加上切换年份的功能了。

## The Impossible Dream (The Quest)

To dream the impossible dream

To fight the unbeatable foe

To bear with unbearable sorrow

To run where the brave dare not go

To right the unrightable wrong

To love pure and chaste from afar

To try when your arms are too weary

To reach the unreachable star

This is my quest

To follow that star

No matter how hopeless

No matter how far

To fight for the right

Without question or pause

To be willing to march int Hell
 
For a heavenly cause

And I know if I'll only be true

To the glorious quest

That my heart will lie peaceful and calm

When I'm laid to my rest

And the world will be better for this

That one man, scorned an coverd with scars

Still strove with his last ounce of courage

To reach the unreachable stars.
